For demo deployment from ready-images see: https://github.com/cernbox/uboxed
For scalable and highly-available deployment with Kubernetes see: //github.com/cernbox/kuboxed



==========================

The following instructions are deprecated.
Images should be built and pushed to a Docker Container Registry service independenlty on the others.

Please refer to CHANGELOG.md for the list of changes applied over time to Docker images.
Please refer to the single Dockerfiles for instructions on how to build and push Docker images.

==========================

Initialize the user deployment repo first:

 # git submodule init
 # git submodule update


How to use:

 1. Install required software on the Centos7 host or check [*] for other OSes
     
    ./uboxed/SetupInstall-Centos7.sh
    

 2. Setup and initialize all services:

    ./BuildHost.sh


 3. Quick test of the services:

    ./uboxed/TestHost.sh


 4. Go to: https://yourhost
 
Enjoy and give feedback to CERN/IT.

[*] Host OS Support

We test this package on Centos7 hosts. For other OSes you may need some extra work (and sweat or tears). 
We are happy to hear from you and eventually include instructions for other OSes.

Required software on the host:

  - install wget, fuse
  - install docker (version 17.03.1-ce or greater)
  - install docker-compose (version 1.11.2 or greater)
