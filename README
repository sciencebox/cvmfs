==========================
THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT REPO
==========================

This is a developer repository: build and rune images from Docker files.

For quick "user" deployment from ready-images see: https://github.com/cernbox/uboxed

Initialize the user deployment repo first:

 # git submodule init
 # git submodule update


How to use:

 1. Install required software on the Centos7 host or check [*] for other OSes
     
    ./uboxed/SetupInstall-Centos7.sh
    

 2. Setup and initialize all services:

    ./BuildHost.sh


 3. Quick test of the services:

    ./uboxed/TestHost.sh


 4. Go to: https://yourhost
 
Enjoy and give feedback to CERN/IT.

[*] Host OS Support

We test this package on Centos7 hosts. For other OSes you may need some extra work (and sweat or tears). 
We are happy to hear from you and eventually include instructions for other OSes.

Required software on the host:

  - install wget, fuse
  - install docker (version 17.03.1-ce or greater)
  - install docker-compose (version 1.11.2 or greater)
