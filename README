[*] Host OS Support

We test this package on Centos7 hosts. For other OSes you may need some extra work (and sweat or tears). 
We are happy to hear from you and eventually include instructions for other OSes.

Required software on the host:

  - install wget, fuse
  - install docker (version 17.03.1-ce or greater)
  - install docker-compose (version 1.11.2 or greater)
